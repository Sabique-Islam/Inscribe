[This piece is unfinished.]

## January
Mostly buried in **1st semester finals**.  
No big builds.

## February
Participated in **1 hackathon** and finished **Top 10**.  
Good experience.

## March
Spent most of the month learning **Python frameworks** and the **basics of ML**.

Built small predictive projects:
- Crop prediction  
- Stroke prediction  

Got into **NeuralHive**, the AIML club at **PESU EC Campus**.

Tried getting into **Web3**, realized it didn’t fit alongside academics, and dropped it early.

## April

Applied to many state level hackathons. Got rejected from all of them.

## May
Went deeper into **NLP**.

Learned:
- **GloVe embeddings**
- **Cosine similarity**
- Vector-based matching

Built an **[Activity Recommender CLI](https://github.com/Sabique-Islam/activity-recommender-cli)** using these concepts.

## June
**End-sem exams.**  
Low-output month. That was expected.

## July
Holidays. Finally time to build.

Built **PESXchange**, a **C2C platform** with friends to exchange items within the college campus.  

Also got in touch with an **early-stage startup idea**.

## July–November
Worked on an **agentic AI desktop app** ( like Cluely).

- Shipped a working product  
- Reached **350+ waitlist signups**  
- Got traction on **X** and **Instagram**

## August
**3rd semester started.**  
Kept upskilling alongside classes — no stopping from here.

## September
Balanced startup work with college.

Went to a college hackathon with an ambitious idea:  
an **AI-powered dashboard for PESU Academy** (think *Cursor for VS Code*, but for the student portal).

The idea was too big for **24 hours**. Couldn’t ship it. Lesson learned.

## October
Applied to **ACM** and **HSP** clubs at PESU EC.  
Got into **both** — something I’d looked up to since first year :)

## November
A messy month.

- Multiple projects  
- Exams and assignments  
- Heavy context switching  

Still kept building, but learned where my limits actually are.

## December
**End-sem exams**, (and I have no clue how all the best ideas come during exams itself)

Started documenting my learnings here -> [What I'm Learning](https://gitlab.com/nopejs/what-i-am-learning)

[Notion Journal](https://www.notion.so/2c4c01e7381380379134c5f6b91b1889?v=2c4c01e7381381808c86000ca8a7df33)

- Went on a **project streak**
- Built a [site](https://sortingscroll.nopejs.me) using **Zola SSG** with a custom theme
- Open-sourced it under **MIT**
- Applied to the **Netlify OSS Program** → **approved**

Other builds :

- https://dotmd.nopejs.me
- https://cdn.nopejs.me
- https://nopelog.nopejs.me
- https://nopebin.lovable.app [will make my version soon]

Kept posting small wins on **X**.

Also got on a call with:
- an **Aussie founder**
- a **VPN SaaS founder from Russia**
- a **Bussiness School** student from Masters' Union
