tldr: "Did someone really make us, or are we just the result of a chain of cosmic coincidences? Why do we follow beliefs we've never questioned? Here's my take on humanity’s obsession with certainty, the origins of faith, and why the truth — about us, and everything — might just live in the shades of grey."

# Introduction ➤

I was rewatching `interstellar` again — umm well lost the count by now. There's something about it that invokes a quiet part of me every single time. Perhaps it's the vast space or the way it makes you questions the things we take for granted.

This thought — "what even are we ??" — has always lingered at the back of my mind. Were we really created by some superior being, or are we just an accident of physics and probability? Why do we cling so tightly to beliefs passed down to us without ever pausing to question them?

Today I attempt to put that restlessness into words. And it's not to find answers — because maybe there are none.

## Why are we Even Here ?

When you look up at the sky , it's impossible not to feel small. The light from some of those stars left millions of years ago — long before we even existed (fascinating indeed) and then comes the humans ("we", "us"), staring at the universe asking for answers.

Science doesn't claim to have all the answers either — it's a work in progress, always questioning itself, discovering new stuff. It tells us that everything began with matter clumping together, gravity doing its own thing, chemistry turning into biology (ok I won't go deep in the scientific stuff), and somewhere along that chain, awareness flickered to life. Religion, on the other hand, gives that mystery a name — it says we were made with purpose, shaped in someone's image. 

(this reminds me of a `transformers` quote, [*"Gotta wonder. If god made us in his image, who made him?"*](https://youtu.be/Y4zzJuceG0o?si=sY_g4ZeBWlPu22NF) )

But here's a weird thing — the more we discover, the less we actually know. Every new telescope, every equation, just opens another layer of mystery. Maybe the question itself — "the act of wondering" — is what makes us human.

## From Survival to Meaning ➤

Somewhere along the timeline, when the fires were lit and languages began to form, we started doing something strange — "WONDER" (idk what I'm saying). The Stars became Gods, Guardian, Symbols and Signs of Destiny. Thunder took the place of divine anger.

It’s easy to see why. We were scared, alone on a massive rock spinning through darkness and needed something to make sense. So we created stories. We needed meaning more than we needed truth.

As time passed, those stories evolved into systems — beliefs, rituals, rules, and eventually religions. Each shaped by geography, culture, and time. People in the deserts saw one kind of god; those in the forests imagined another.

## Faith and Friction ➤

What began as stories of hope slowly turned into systems of control. The same beliefs that once united tribes around campfires began drawing borders between civilizations. "My god", "your god", "our truth", "their lies". Strange how something meant to connect us ended up separating us.

If there truly was one creator, why leave room for so many conflicting versions of truth? Why let faith become a reason to hate, to fight, to feel superior? Maybe that’s the paradox — the moment we stopped seeing faith as wonder and started seeing it as ownership, we lost its meaning.

Religion gave humans moral direction, community, and comfort — but it also gave us wars, judgment, and ego. And the tragedy is, most people never question it. They inherit beliefs the same way they inherit surnames — without choice or thought.

> Blind Belief is Easy and Thinking takes effort.

## The Lost Art of Thinking ➤

Somewhere along the line, we stopped thinking for ourselves. The world got louder with everyone shouting opinions and nobody's really listening. We scroll, consume, react… but rarely reflect.

It's funny, isn't it? We have access to more knowledge than any generation before us, yet we barely "think". Everything's pre-packaged — ideas, morals, even outrage. You don’t form beliefs anymore, you pick them from what's trending to fit in.

We mistake noise for awareness. We confuse agreement with understanding. And that is where critical thinking dies.

Critical thought used to be a strength — today it's rebellion. The moment you question something, people label you "cynical", "negative", or "anti-something". It's easier to fit in than to stand alone with your own mind.

The truth?
We've become experts at repeating and who even cares about reasoning. Borrowed opinions. Manufactured emotions.
A society running on autopilot — full of minds that no longer know what silence feels like.

## The Cosmic Joke ➤

Sometimes I wonder if the universe ever laughs — watching us argue, build, destroy, love, and pray, all while spinning on a pale blue dot that could vanish tomorrow and no one would notice (I mean....We are that Insignificant).

We write philosophies, fight wars, chase money, fall in love, die (some may have different orders :) — but in the silence between galaxies, none of it echoes. The stars don’t care who we are. The black holes don’t pause for our grief. To them, we are a blink.

And yet, that's what makes us beautiful.
That despite knowing how small we are, we still create, still dream, still love. We scream into the void hoping it screams back — and maybe that’s all life really is. A cosmic conversation between nothingness and awareness.

Maybe even if God exists, it’s not the way we picture it to be — but perhaps something far stranger. Maybe we’re just a failed laboratory experiment of some high-dimensional high schooler who forgot to clean up after class. Who knows?

I like to think somewhere out there, beyond light and time, some beings already found the peace we keep chasing here —
- where no one fights for gods or flags or egos.
- where love isn’t limited by borders or belief.

## Shades of Grey ➤

Perhaps that's the lesson after all — that not everything needs an answer, not every question needs a side. The world is  a spectrum of — faith and doubt, reason and feeling, chaos and calm.

No opinion or take is ever absolute. You can't hold to either end and call it truth — for truth rarely lives in the extremes. It's always grey (Gandalf the Grey yuhuuuu!! Sorry :), somewhere in between what we believe and what we refuse to see.

We crave certainty because it feels safe, we make up stories to answer the unanswerable. But this isn't what life should be — it was meant to be real. And in reality....well it has no clean edges. It’s messy and contradictory... just like us.

Truth isn’t found in conclusions or convictions alone — it lives somewhere in between. In our curiosity, in our humility to admit *"I don’t know"*. That might just be the purest form of wisdom.

So maybe the goal isn’t to find answers at all — maybe it’s to stay curious enough to keep asking.
- To think and not follow.
- To seek and not settle.
- To live in the shades of grey — because that’s where the real colors hide.

## Afterthoughts ➤

As I write this, I'm 18 — still learning, making mistakes, and trying to make sense of the world. Maybe everything I've said here is entirely absurd, or maybe it’s the most valid thing I'll ever write. Who knows?

The point is to encourage rational thinking. Because the moment we start believing we’ve figured it all out, that’s when we stop growing.

Every belief I hold today might fall apart tomorrow — and that’s okay. That’s progress. The beauty of thinking is a conversation with yourself that never really ends.

And maybe that's all we ever need — not answers, not conclusions — but the courage to keep asking, and the humility to know we might.
