Hey, I’m **Sabique**, a B.Tech CSE student based in Bangalore, Karnataka. I’m learning web development, blogging, grinding through DSA, and doing a bit of creative writing on the side.

This blog is where I share what I’m working on, including projects, experiments, successes, failures and everything in between.

## What You'll Find Here ➤

- **Programming tips & tutorials** → real-world stuff I’ve tried and tested
- **Project breakdowns** → behind-the-scenes on my experiments, apps, and random builds
- **Tech takes & opinions** → sometimes spicy, always honest
- **Best practices** → the good habits I’ve picked up (and the bad ones I’m still unlearning)
